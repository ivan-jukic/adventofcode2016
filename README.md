# Advent of Code 2016
### [http://adventofcode.com/2016](http://adventofcode.com/2016)

In this repo I'll be putting my solutions to daily puzzles of 2016 adventofcode challenge.

I am using [Elm lang](http://elm-lang.org/) for my solutions, a decision I've made with hope that these challenges will improve
my understanding of the Elm language, and maybe even help some of you guys who are reading and are interested in this.
